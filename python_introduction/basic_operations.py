#Assigning values to variables

number1 = 10
number2 = 5

#Performing Basic Arithmetic Operations

Addition = number1 + number2
Substraction = number1 - number2
Multiplication = number1 * number2

#Printing the Results
print("The Addition of", number1, "and", number2, "is", Addition)
print("The Substraction of", number1, "and", number2, "is", Substraction)
print("The Multiplication of", number1, "and", number2, "is", Multiplication)
